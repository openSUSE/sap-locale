This package contains all the SAP specific locales needed for running
an SAP Application Server.

The SAP applications were originally written at a time when the
standards for various locales were either not defined at all or were
not in wide usage yet before the release of the SAP applications.

Consequently, there now exists a divergency between the needs of
the SAP applications running under Linux and what is being supplied
via the GNU C Library Locales, which follows the current standards
for the various defined locales.

In order to be able to use SAP applications under SUSE Linux (and
especially under SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES)), Novell is
supplying this package which contains the legacy locales required
for the SAP applications. The detailed list of locales is provided
in package documentation. These locales can coexist with the standard
locales on your system.

This package covers the following locales, specifically:

    * cs_CZ.iso88592@SAP
      Czech using Latin-2 charset but with sorting order compatible with
      HP-UX and Windows instead of SunOS, Linux and CSN 97 6030 - numbers
      are sorted before letters in this locale.

    * sk_SK.iso88592@SAP
      Slovak using Latin-2 charset but with sorting order compatible with
      HP-UX and Windows instead of SunOS, Linux and CSN 97 6030 - numbers
      are sorted before letters in this locale.

    * de_DE.iso88591@SAP_HP
      Same as "de_DE.iso88591", but using the same collate as applies for
      the "de_DE.iso88591" locale on HPUX systems.

    * et_EE.iso88594@SAP
      Estonian using "Latin-4" as charset (the standard "glibc-locale"
      installation is using "Latin-1" also known as "ISO-8859-1" as charset).

    * lt_LT.iso88594@SAP
      Lithuanian using "Latin-4" as charset (the standard "glibc-locale"
      installation is using "Latin-1" also known as "ISO-8859-1" as charset).

    * lv_LV.iso88594@SAP
      Latvian using "Latin-4" as charset (the standard "glibc-locale"
      installation is using "Latin-1" also known as "ISO-8859-1" as charset).

    * ko_KR.euckr@SAP
      Korean locale using charset EUC-KR (superset of "KSC5601").

    * tr_TR.iso88599@SAP
      Based on the "tr_TR" locale contained in "glibc-locale", but changes
      the "to{upper,lower}()" conversions found in the "glibc-locale"
      version for the following characters in the Turkish charset using
      ISO 8859-9:

	0x49 (U0049) <=> 0xfd (U0131)  and  0xfd (U0131) <=> 0x49 (U0049)
	0x69 (U0069) <=> 0xdd (U0130)  and  0xdd (U0130) <=> 0x69 (U0069).

      to what is needed on SAP systems:

	0x49 (U0049) <=> 0x69 (U0069)  and  0xfd (U0131) <=> 0xdd (U0130)
	0x69 (U0069) <=> 0x49 (U0049)  and  0xdd (U0130) <=> 0xfd (U0131).

      Using the SAP mapping of these characters resolved the ambiguous
      definitions found in the standard "glibc-locale" definitions that
      arise from the standard ISO 8859-9 definition itself.

      In the ISO 8859-9 standard, these unambiguous mappings are
      specified:

	0x49 (U0049) <=> 0x69 (U0069)
	0x69 (U0069) <=> 0x49 (U0049)

      together with these ambiguous definitions:

	0xfd (U0131) <=> 0x49 (U0049)	(ambiguous with the above!)
	0xdd (U0130) <=> 0x69 (U0069)	(ambiguous with the above!)

    * ja_JP.SAPSJIS
      ja_JP locale using customized SJIS charmap covering also characters
      from the 0xExxx codepoint range.

      Note that the SJIS charset conversion is aliased to SAPSJIS in case
      this package is installed!
